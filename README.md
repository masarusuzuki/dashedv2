# dashedv2
The website that has all your favorite links.
We depend on your donation to keep this project going.
This project started by Masaru Suzuk (EnquikLabs) after he discovered that many people on the internet were giving away all their information to sketchy "New Tab" extensions. Of course there are notable extenstions such as Momentum. Our solution doesn't require the end user to install anything that could steal your information.

We at EnquikLabs believe in privacy. Help us stop the bad people on the internet.
